/*
 Write a Java program which assigns your name to one variable and some other
 numerical value you want to share to another variable (e.g. age, number of pets,
 number of children, etc.). Then print a greeting along with the value of the name
 variable to the screen on one line and a message that uses the other variable with 
 numerical value to another line.
